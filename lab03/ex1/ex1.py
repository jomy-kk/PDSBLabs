    Elgendi et al.[2010] uses a bandpass filter and two moving averages to segment the ECG signal into blocks containing
    potential QRS complexes. The ECG signal is filtered using a second order Butterworth IIR filter with a passband of
    8 â€“ 20 Hz. The first moving average has a window of 120 ms to match the approximate duration of a QRS complex.
    A wider window of 600 ms is used for the second moving average to match the approximate duration of a complete
    heartbeat. Both moving averages are performed on the rectified bandpass filtered signal. Sections of the filtered
    ECG where the amplitude of the first moving average is higher than that of the second are marked as blocks
    containing a potential heartbeat. Blocks with a width of less than 80 ms are ignored as this is smaller than a QRS
    complex. The maximum value of the filtered ECG in each block is then stored as a detected QRS. Detections which
    follow the previous one by less than 300 ms are removed.
